# Tableau-Airline-Reviews-Data-Analysis
This Tableau project presents an in-depth analysis of airline reviews using various visualizations and filters to enable users to interact with and understand the data effectively. 

## Datasets
Two datasets have been used in this project: Airline Reviews.csv and Countries.csv

## Sheets in Tableau
The workbook contains the following sheets:

### Creating Map and Parameter
Two datasets were linked in Tableau by assigning a geographic role to the place column, ensuring accurate mapping using built-in geocoding. A dynamic parameter was created to analyze criteria such as Overall rating, Cabin staff Service, Entertainment, Food, Ground service, Seat comfort, and Value for Money. The map was customized with adjusted backgrounds and colors for clear visual presentation, complemented by a dynamic title reflecting selected data for enhanced dashboard clarity and usability.

### Creating Filters
Implemented filters in Tableau facilitate comprehensive data analysis. These include continuous month selection for precise time filtering, seat type and traveler type filters for segmentation, and a continent filter for geographic analysis.

### Creating Summary Page
Creating a summary page in Tableau involved setting up a text table to display all metrics vertically, with names and values. The header was hidden, and values were formatted to be bold and placed at the top, with centered alignment and adjusted decimal formatting. Row dividers were removed for a cleaner presentation, and metrics were reordered for clarity and coherence.
